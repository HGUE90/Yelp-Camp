YelpCamp is currently under development, with several key features in the works. The application aims to provide a user-friendly experience for campers by allowing them to browse campgrounds, leave reviews, and manage their camping experiences all in one place. As I continue to enhance the app, Iâ€™m focusing on implementing robust functionality and a sleek design. This project is developed as part of Colt Steele's web development course, which has been instrumental in guiding my learning and design process.
